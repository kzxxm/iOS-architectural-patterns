## What is MVI

MVI is a software architectural pattern inspired by the Elm architecture and Redux. IT focuses on treated the UI as a function of state, where user interactions are captured as "Intents" that trigger state changes, which then trigger UI updates. The key principle is **unidirectional data flow** with immutable state objects.

## The Three Components

### 1. Model (State)
**What it is**
Represents the **immutable state** of the entire screen/feature

**Responsibilities**
- Holding all data needed to render the UI
- Representing every possible state the screen can be in
- Being completely immutable (new state objects are created for changes)

**What it doesn't do**
Contains no business logic of behaviour

### 2. View
**What it is**
A pure function that renders state and emits intents

**Responsibilities**
- Rendering the current state
- Capturing user interactions as Intents
- Being a pure function of the current state

**What it doesn't do**
Contains no business logic, doesn't hold state

### 3. Intent
**What it is**
Represents user intentions or external events

**Responsibilities**
- Capturing all possible user actions
- Representing external events (network responses, timers, etc.)
- Being processed to create new states

**What it doesn't do**
Doesn't contains business logic directly

## How MVI Works

The **unidirectional data flow** in MVI:

1. **View** renders the current **State**
2. User interacts with **View**, creating an **Intent**
3. **Intent** is processed by business logic (reducer) to create a new **State**
4. New **State** triggers **View** re-rendering
5. Cycle repeats

#### Key Principles
- State is immutable
- Data flows in one direction only
- UI is a pure function of state
- All changes happen through intents

## Pros and Cons of MVI

### *Pros*
#### Predictable State Management
- All state changes happen through intents
- Easy to trace what caused a state change
- Immutable state prevents accidental mutations
#### Excellent Testability
- Pure functions are east to test
- State changes are deterministic
- Can test all possible states and transitions
#### Time Travel Debugging
- Can record and play all intents
- Easy to reproduce bugs
- State history is trackable
#### Unidirectional Data Flow
- Data flows in one clear direcion
- No circular dependencies
- East to reason about complex UIs
#### Scalable Architecture
- Handles complex state well
- Easy to add new features
- Clear separation of concerns
#### Reactive by Design
- Natural fit for reactive programming
- Easy to compose complex behaviours
- Side effects are explicit and controlled
### *Cons*
#### High Learning Curve
- Requires understanding of functional programming concepts
- Immutable state can be confusing initially
- More abstract than traditional patterns
#### Boilerplate Code
- Lots of ceremony for simple operations
- Need to define intents for every action
- State objects can become large
#### Performance Considerations
- Creating new state objects for every change
- Can be memory intensive for large states
- Need to be careful about unnecessary re-renders
#### Over-Engineering Risk
- Can be overkill for simple applications
- Easy to create unnecessary complexity
- May slow down development for straightforward features
#### Debugging Complexity
- State changes can be hard to trace in complex flows
- Side effects management can become complex
- Requires good logging and debugging tools

## Best Practices for MVI in iOS

- **Keep State Immutable:** Never mutate state objects directly
- **Use Structs for State:** Leverage Swift's value types for immutability
- **Handle Side Effects Separately:** Keep reducers pure, handle side effects in stores
- **Design Clear Intents:** Make intents descriptive and granular
- **Reducer for Business Logic:** All business logic lives in the reducer
- **Store for Side Effects:** Side effects such as async tasks, persistence, network calls etc which can't happen in a pure reducer should take place in a store
- **Optimise State Updates:** Use diffing for large state objects
- **Test Reducers Thoroughly:** Focus testing on state transitions
- **Use Equatable for Performance:** Implement Equatable on state to prevent unnecessary updates

## When to Use MVI

MVI works exceptionally well when:

- **Complex state management** - Multiple interdependent state pieces
- **Predictability is crucial** - Need to track all state changes
- **Time travel debugging needed** - Want to replay user sessions
- **Team comfortable with functional programming** - Understands immutability concepts
- **Long-term maintainability** - Large applications that need to scale
- **Real-time applications** - Apps with lots of reactive data

## MVI in Practice

The key to successful MVI is understanding that:

- **Everything is a function:** UI is a function of state, new state is a function of old state + intent
- **State tells the whole story:** Looking at state should tell you everything about the UI
- **Intents capture all interactions:** Every user action and external event becomes an intent
- **Side effects are explicit:** All async operations and external interactions are clearly separated

MVI shines in applications where you need maximum predictability and the ability to reason about complex state changes over time.
