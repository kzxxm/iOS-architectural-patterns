## MVC (Model-View-Controller)

### What It Is
Traditional iOS pattern where View Controllers manage both UI and business logic.
### Key Characteristics
- ✅ Simple and familiar
- ✅ Built into iOS SDK
- ❌ Massive View Controllers
- ❌ Hard to test
### When to Use
- **✅ Small projects** (< 10 screens)
- **✅ Learning iOS development**
- **✅ Rapid prototyping**
- **✅ Simple CRUD apps**
### When NOT to Use
- ❌ Complex business logic
- ❌ Multiple developers
- ❌ Long-term maintenance
- ❌ Extensive testing needed
### Code Structure
```
ViewController (handles everything) 
├── UI Logic 
├── Business Logic 
├── Network calls 
└── Data formatting
```


## MVP (Model-View-Presenter)

### What It Is
Passive View that delegates all logic to a Presenter, which coordinates with the Model.
### Key Characteristics
- ✅ Excellent testability
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Passive views
- ❌ More boilerplate than MVC
### When to Use
- **✅ Testing is important**
- **✅ Clear separation needed**
- **✅ Medium complexity apps**
- **✅ UIKit projects**
### When NOT to Use
- ❌ Simple apps (overkill)
- ❌ SwiftUI (MVVM is better)
- ❌ Very complex state management
### Code Structure
```
View (passive) 
├── Presenter (coordination logic) 
│   └── Model (business logic) 
└── User interactions → Presenter
```

## MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

### What It Is
View observes ViewModel through data binding; ViewModel transforms Model data for the View.
### Key Characteristics
- ✅ Perfect for SwiftUI
- ✅ Reactive data binding
- ✅ Great testability
- ❌ Can be complex with reactive programming
### When to Use
- **✅ SwiftUI applications**
- **✅ Reactive UIs with lots of state**
- **✅ Real-time data updates**
- **✅ Form-heavy applications**
### When NOT to Use
- ❌ Simple, static UIs
- ❌ Team unfamiliar with reactive programming
- ❌ UIKit without reactive frameworks
### Code Structure
```
View (observes ViewModel) 
├── ViewModel (@Published properties) 
│   └── Model (business logic) 
└── Automatic UI updates via data binding
```

## MVI (Model-View-Intent)

### What It Is
Unidirectional data flow where user Intents create new immutable State, which updates the View.
### Key Characteristics
- ✅ Predictable state changes
- ✅ Time-travel debugging possible
- ✅ Unidirectional data flow
- ❌ High learning curve
### When to Use
- **✅ Complex state management**
- **✅ Predictability is crucial**
- **✅ State synchronization needed**
- **✅ Debugging complex flows**
### When NOT to Use
- ❌ Simple applications
- ❌ Team unfamiliar with functional programming
- ❌ Rapid development needed
### Code Structure
```
`Intent → Reducer → New State → View Update 
└── Immutable state, pure functions`
```

## TCA (The Composable Architecture)

### What It Is
Point-Free's opinionated implementation of unidirectional architecture with powerful tooling and composition.
### Key Characteristics
- ✅ Outstanding testability
- ✅ Time-travel debugging
- ✅ Composable features
- ✅ Type-safe effects
- ❌ Steep learning curve
- ❌ Heavy boilerplate
### When to Use
- **✅ Complex, long-term applications**
- **✅ Multiple interconnected features**
- **✅ Team values consistency**
- **✅ Extensive testing requirements**
### When NOT to Use
- ❌ Simple apps
- ❌ Rapid prototyping
- ❌ Small teams
- ❌ Learning projects
### Code Structure
```
`Action → Reducer → State → View 
├── Effects (side effects) 
├── Dependencies (injected) 
└── Store (state container)`
```

## VIPER (View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-Router)

### What It Is
Five-layer architecture with extreme separation of concerns and clear module boundaries.
### Key Characteristics
- ✅ Maximum separation of concerns
- ✅ Highly modular
- ✅ Great for large teams
- ❌ Extreme complexity
- ❌ Massive boilerplate
- ❌ Over-engineering risk
### When to Use
- **✅ Large enterprise applications**
- **✅ Multiple teams working in parallel**
- **✅ Long-term maintenance (5+ years)**
- **✅ Complex business domains**
### When NOT to Use
- ❌ Small to medium apps
- ❌ SwiftUI projects
- ❌ Rapid development
- ❌ Small teams
### Code Structure
```
View ↔ Presenter ↔ Interactor ↔ Entity
	   ↓     Router (navigation)
```

## Quick Selection Guide

**New to iOS?** → Start with **MVC**
**Using SwiftUI?** → Go with **MVVM**
**Need extensive testing?** → Choose **MVP** or **TCA**
**Complex state management?** → Pick **TCA** or **MVI**
**Large enterprise team?** → Consider **VIPER**
**Time pressure?** → Stick with **MVC** or **MVVM**

## Pro Tips

### Evolution Path

`MVC → MVP → MVVM → MVI/TCA`

_Start simple, evolve as needed_

### Red Flags
- **Massive View Controllers** → Move to MVP/MVVM
- **Hard to test** → Consider MVP/TCA
- **Complex state bugs** → Look at MVI/TCA
- **Team communication issues** → Try VIPER

### Golden Rules
1. **Start simple** - Don't over-engineer
2. **Know your team** - Match architecture to skill level
3. **Consider timeline** - Complex architectures take time
4. **Think long-term** - Will this be maintained for years?
5. **Be consistent** - Pick one and stick with it
