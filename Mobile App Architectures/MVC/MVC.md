## What is MVC

MVC is a software architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components. It's designed to promote organised code, separation of concerns and maintainability by clearly defining the responsibilities of different parts of your applications.

## The Three Components

### 1. Model
**What is it?**
Represents the data and business logic of your application

**Responsibilities**
- Data storage and retrieval
- Business rules and validation
- Network requests and data processing
- State management

**What it doesn't do**
Doesn't know anything about the user interface

### 2. View
**What is it?**
The user interface layer that displays information to users

**Responsibilities**
- Rendering the UI elements
- Displaying data from the Model
- Capturing user interactions (taps, swipes, etc.)

**What it doesn't do**
Doesn't contain any business logic or directly manipulate data

### 3. Controller
**What is it?**
The intermediary that coordinates between Model and View 

**Responsibilities**
- Receives user input from the View
- Processes that input and updates the Model
- Updates the View when the Model changes
- Contains the application's flow logic

## How MVC Works

A typical MVC communication flow is as follows:

1. User interacts with the **View**
2. **View** notifies the **Controller** of the interaction
3. **Controller** processes the input and updates the **Model**
4. **Model** notifies the **Controller** of changes
5. **Controller** updates the **View** to reflect the new state

## Pros and Cons of MVC
### *Pros*
#### Clear Separation of Concerns
- Each component has a well-defined responsibility
- Makes code more organised and easier to understand
#### Reusability
- Models can be reused across different views
- Views can work with different controllers
- Promotes modular design
#### Testability
- Business logic in the Model can be easily unit tested
- Controllers can be tested independently
- Clear boundaries make mocking easier
#### Team Development
- Different team members can work on different components
- Well-established pattern that most developers understand
#### Maintainability
- Changes to business logic only affect the Model
- UI changes only affect the view
- Easier to locate and fix the bugs
### *Cons*
#### Massive View Controller Problem
- Controllers can become bloated with too much responsibility
- In traditional iOS development, view controllers often handle both view logic and business logic
#### Tight Coupling Issues
- Views and Controllers can become tightly coupled
- Controllers often need to know about specific view implementations
#### Complexity for Simple Apps
- Can be overkill for very simple applications
- Adds layers of abstraction that might not be necessary
#### Data Flow Ambiguity
- In complex apps, the flow of data can become unclear
- Multiple controllers updating the same model can lead to confusion
#### Testing Challenges
- Controllers that manage both UI and business logic are harder to test
- UI Testing becomes more complex with the additional layers

## Best Practices for MVC in iOS

- **Keep Controllers Thin:** Move business logic to the Model and UI logic to the View
- **Use Protocols:** Define interfaces between components to reduce coupling
- **Leverage Notifications:** Use NotificationCenter or Combine for loose coupling
- **Consider MVVM:** For SwiftUI, MVVM might be more natural than traditional MVC

## When to Use MVC

MVC works well when:
- You have a clear separation between data, presentation and logic
- Your team is familiar with the pattern
- You're building medium-complexity applications
- You want a tried-and-tested architectural approach
