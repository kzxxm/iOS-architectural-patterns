## What is MVP

MVP is a software architectural pattern that's an evolution of MVS, designed to address some of MVC's limitations. It separates an application into three components with a key difference - the View and Model never communicate directly, all communications flows through the Presenter. This results in better testability and cleaner separation of concerns. 

## The Three Components

### 1. Model
**What is it?**
Represents the data and business logic (same as MVC)

**Responsibilities**
- Data storage and retrieval
- Business rules and validation
- Network requests and data processing
- State management

**What it doesn't do**
Doesn't know anything about the view or presenter

### 2. View
**What is it?**
A passive interface that displays data and captures user input

**Responsibilities**
- Rendering UI elements
- Capturing user interactions (taps, swipes, etc.)
- Delegating all logic to the presenter

**What it doesn't do**
Contains NO business logic, doesn't directly access the Model

### 3. Presenter
**What is it?**
The intermediary that contains ALL presentation logic

**Responsibilities**
- Receives user input from the View
- Processes input and coordinates with the Model
- Formats data for display in the View
- Contains all the UI logic and state management
- Acts as the single source of truth for what the View should display

## How MVP Works
The communications flow in MVP:

1. User interacts with the **View**
2. **View** delegates the action to the **Presenter**
3. **Presenter** processes the input and updates the model
4. **Model** notifies the **Presenter** of changes
5. **Presenter** formats the data and tells the **View** exactly what to display

## Pros and Cons of MVP
### *Pros*
#### Superior Testability
- Presenter contains all logic and has no UI dependencies
- Can easily unit test presentation logic without UI frameworks
- Mock Views can be created for testing
#### Complete Separation of Concerns
- View is completely passive and dumb
- Model focuses purely on data
- Presenter handles all presentation logic
#### Better Organisation
- Clear boundaries between components
- All UI logic is centralised in the Presenter
- Easier to reason about data flow
#### Platform Independence
- Presenter can be reused across different platforms
- Business logic is completely separated from UI frameworks
#### Easier Maintenance
- Changes to UI logic only affect the Presenter
- View changes don't impact business logic
- Clear contract between View and Presenter
### *Cons*
#### Increased Complexity
- More files and classes to manage
- Additional layer of abstraction
- Can be overkill for simple applications
#### Potential for Fat Presenter
- All presentation logic goes into the Presenter
- Can become bloated if not properly organised
- Similar to the "Massive View Controller" problem in MVC
#### More Boilerplate Code
- Requires more setup and interfaces
- Display models add extra layer
- More code to maintain relationships
#### Learning Curve
- Less familiar pattern for some developers
- Requires discipline to maintain proper separation
- Can be confusing initially
#### Over-Engineering Risk
- Easy to create unnecessary abstractions
- Can lead to over-complicated solutions
- May slow down development for simpler features

## Best Practices for MVP in iOS
- **Keep Views Dumb:** Views should only handle UI rendering and user input delegation
- **Use Display Models:** Create specific models for what the View displays
- **Implement Protocols:** Define clear contracts between View and Presenter
- **Avoid Direct Model Access:** Never let the View access the Model directly
- **Test Presenters Thoroughly:** Focus testing efforts on the Presenter logic
- **Use Dependency Injection:** Inject Models into Presenters for better testability

## When to Use MVP
MVP works well when:

**Testability is a high priority** 
- You need extensive unit testing
**Complex Presentation logic**
- Your UI has lots of formatting and state management
**Cross-platform development**
- You want to reuse presentation logic
**Team has separation discipline**
- Developers can maintain proper boundaries
**Medium to large applications**
- The overhead is justified by the benefits
