## What is VIPER

VIPER is a software architectural pattern that separates an application into five distinct components, each with very specific responsibilities. It's designed to create highly decoupled, testable and maintainable code by enforcing strict boundaries between different layers of the application. VIPER is inspired by Clean Architecture principles.

## The Five Components

### 1. View
**What it is**
Passive UI layer that displays data and captures user input

**Responsibilities**
- Rendering UI elements
- Capturing user interactions
- Delegating all actions to the Presenter

**What it doesn't do**
Contains NO business logic, doesn't format data

### 2. Interactor
**What it is**
Contains pure business logic and use cases

**Responsibilities**
- Business rules and validations
- Data manipulation and processing
- Communication with data sources
- Independent of UI

**What it doesn't do**
Doesn't know about UI or presentation concerns

### 3. Presenter
**What it is**
Mediates between View and Interactor, contains presentation logic

**Responsibilities**
- Receiving user actions from View
- Calling appropriate Interactor methods
- Formatting data for display
- Handling navigation requests through Router

**What it doesn't do**
Doesn't contain business logic or direct UI manipulation

### 4. Entity
**What it is**
Simple data models used throughout the application

**Responsibilities**
- Representing data structures
- Being passed between layers
- Containing only data, no behaviour

**What it doesn't do**
Contains no business logic

### 5. Router (Wireframe)
**What it is**
Handles navigation and module creation

**Responsibilities**
- Creating and presenting new modules
- Handling navigation between screens
- Dependency injection for modules

**What it doesn't do**
Doesn't contain business or presentation logic

## How VIPER Works

The communication flow in VIPER

1. View captures user interaction and calls **Presenter**
2. **Presenter** processes the interaction and calls **Interactor** if needed
3. **Interactor** performs business logic and calls back to **Presenter**
4. **Presenter** formats data and updates **View**
5. **Presenter** requests navigation through **Router** when needed

**Key Principle:** Each component only communicates with specific other components through protocols.

## Pros and Cons of VIPER

### *Pros*
#### Exceptional Separation of Concerns
- Each component has a simple, well-defined responsibility
- Maximum decoupling between layers
- Clear boundaries and contracts
- Easy to reason about individual components
#### Outstanding Testability
- Each component can be tested in complete isolation
- Easy to mock dependencies through protocols
- Pure business logic in Interactor
- Clear input/output contracts
#### High Modularity
- Features are completely self-contained modules
- Easy to reuse components across features
- Clear module boundaries
- Support for large team development
#### Scalability
- Handles complex applications very well
- Easy to add new features without affecting existing ones
- Clear navigation and routing
- Supports micro-frontend approaches
#### Protocol-Driven Design
- Strong contracts between components
- Easy to replace implementations
- Supports dependency injection naturally
- Clear API boundaries
### *Cons*
#### Extreme Complexity
- Very steep learning curve
- Lots of boilerplate code
- Over-engineering for simple features
- Can slow down development significantly
#### Massive Boilerplate
- Requires many files for each feature
- Protocols for every component
- Complex setup and wiring
- Repetitive code patterns
#### Hard to Navigate
- Difficult to follow data flow
- Many files to understand a single feature
- Complex debugging across layers
- Overwhelming for new team members
#### Over-Abstraction
- Easy to create unnecessary abstractions
- Can make simple things complicated
- Protocol overhead for trivial operations
- Analysis paralysis in design decisions
#### Development Velocity
- Slow initial development
- High cognitive overhead
- Complex refactoring
- Time-consuming feature implementation
#### SwiftUI Mismatch
- Designed for UIKit paradigms
- Doesn't leverage SwiftUI's reactive nature
- Fighting against SwiftUI's declarative model
- Unnecessary complexity for modern iOS development

## Best Practices for VIPER

- **Use Code Generation:** Create templates to reduce boilerplate
- **Keep Entities Simple:** Pure data objects with no behaviour
- **Test Every Component:** Write comprehensive unit tests
- **Use Dependency Injection:** Wire dependencies through protocols
- **Keep Presenters Thin:** Focus on coordination, not logic
- **Document Contracts:** Clear protocol documentation
- **Consider Alternatives:** Evaluate if VIPER is necessary for your use case

## When to Use VIPER

Viper works well when:

- **Large, complex enterprise applications** - Multiple teams, long-term maintenance
- **Maximum testability required** - Need comprehensive test coverage
- **Team values strict separation** - Disciplined about architectural boundaries
- **Modular development** - Need to develop features independently
- **Legacy UIKit applications** - Already established VIPER codebase
- **Clear feature boundaries** - Well-defined business domains

## When NOT to Use VIPER

Avoid VIPER when:

- **Small to medium applications** - Overhead outweighs benefits
- **SwiftUI-first development** - Better patterns available for SwiftUI
- **Rapid prototyping** - Need fast development cycles
- **Small team** - Communication overhead not justified
- **Simple requirements** - Straightforward CRUD applications
- **Learning projects** - Too complex for educational purposes
